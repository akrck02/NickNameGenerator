# Nickname generator

Hi there, This is a simple program that generates a random nickname for you. Its based on the [nickname file by @onyxrev](https://github.com/onyxrev/common_nickname_csv/).

I added some suffix and prefix files and random appendage to the nicknames so that you can have a more random nickname.

I will be updating this program whenever I get a chance to, so please check back often. This is a little project compared to the other ones I have been working on GitHub.
